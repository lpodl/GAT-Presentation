Graph Attention Networks were among the first architectures to combine the structural nature of graph data with node-level information. They have proven to be applicable to real-world problems and still hold up to todays evaluation standards. As promising as they are, recent publications indicate that Graph Convolutional Networks in general are limited and significant improvements or entirely new architectures are needed to find solutions to long-range problems.
